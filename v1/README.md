# Limitations
- No Natural Language Processing

- Limited Object Types
  - Only supports 3 primitive shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder)
- Basic Material System
  - Only supports adding colors, no advanced materials (metallic, glass, emission, etc.)
- No Batch Operations
  - Cannot create multiple objects in a single operation. Must complete one operation before starting another
- No Curves or Surfaces
- Limited Manipulation Options
  - Basic move/scale/rotate only, no advanced transformations
- No Object Selection
  - Manipulation operations work on "last created" object rather than specific selection
- Basic Camera Settings
    - The camera does not adjust as objects move or are created in various coordinates and the saved PNG may not capture all objects
