# Core Features

## Natural Language Processing
- Complete replacement of menu-driven interface with OpenAI-powered command interpretation
- V1 required navigating numbered menu options

## Intelligent Parameter Parsing
- Automatically extracts object type, location, size, and color from free-form text commands
- V1 required manual input for each parameter through menus

## Pydantic Schema Validation
- Type-safe parameter parsing and validation system
- V1 had basic input validation only

## Enhanced Color Recognition
- Expanded from 7 preset colors to 10 predefined color names with intelligent text parsing
- V1 required selecting from numbered color menu

## Smart Name Validation
- Automatic unique name generation with conflict resolution
- V1 required manual unique naming with duplicate prevention prompts

## Missing Attribute Analysis
- Identifies and reports what parameters were defaulted vs. explicitly provided by user
- V1 had no parameter analysis

## User Confirmation Dialogs
- Shows parsed parameters before execution for verification
- V1 executed immediately after menu selections

## Object Clarification Prompts
- Interactive selection when object names are ambiguous during manipulation
- V1 worked only on "last created" object

## Session-based File Management
- Unique session IDs for blend files and renders instead of fixed "result.blend"
- Enables multiple concurrent sessions

## Structured Output Processing
- Uses OpenAI's structured output format for reliable command interpretation
- V1 had no AI integration

# V2 Limitations

## Limited Object Types
- Still only supports 3 primitive shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder)

## Basic Material System
- Only supports color changes, no advanced materials (metallic, glass, emission, etc.)

## No Batch Operations
- Cannot create multiple objects in a single command

## No Curves or Surfaces
- Limited to basic mesh primitives only

## No Help System
- No built-in guidance or command examples for users
